      "details1":"Jay Shetty, social media superstar and host of the number one podcast On Purpose, distills the timeless wisdom he learned as a monk into practical steps anyone can take every day to live a less anxious, more meaningful life.When you think like a monk. Shetty grew up in a family where you could become one of three things - a doctor, a lawyer, or a failure. His family was convinced he had chosen option three: Instead of attending his college graduation ceremony, he headed to India to become a monk, to meditate every day for four to eight hours, and devote his life to helping others. After three years, one of his teachers told him that he would have more impact on the world if he left the monk’s path to share his experience and wisdom with others. Heavily in debt, and with no recognizable skills on his résumé, he moved back home in North London with his parents. Shetty reconnected with old school friends - many working for some of the world’s largest corporations - who were experiencing tremendous stress, pressure, and unhappiness, and they invited Shetty to coach them on well-being, purpose, and mindfulness.Since then, Shetty has become one of the world’s most popular influencers. In 2017, he was named in the Forbes magazine 30-under-30 for being a game-changer in the world of media. In 2018, he had the number one video on Facebook with more than 360 million views. His social media following totals more than 38 million, he has produced more than 400 viral videos that have amassed more than eight billion views, and his podcast, On Purpose, is consistently ranked the world’s number one health and wellness podcast. In this inspiring, empowering book, Shetty draws on his time as a monk to show us how we can clear the roadblocks to our potential and power. Combining ancient wisdom and his own rich experiences in the ashram, Think Like a Monk reveals how to overcome negative thoughts and habits and access the calm and purpose that lie within all of us. He transforms abstract lessons into advice and exercises we can all apply to reduce stress, improve relationships, and give the gifts we find in ourselves to the world. Shetty proves that everyone can - and should - think like a monk."

      "details1": "How does Stephen Fry do it? The pantheon of Greek Gods was never boring to me, but could be confusing and WAS bizarre and alien. Fry has made it so...Human. This is a man who knows his subject so well that he can play with it, adding bits of cosmological physics and a Monty Python reference about cheese, yet still teach us about pounds, shillings and pence as well as the labyrinthine origins of these mythic beings. Here are the thrills, grandeur, and unabashed fun of the Greek myths, stylishly retold by Stephen Fry. The legendary writer, actor, and comedian breathes life into ancient tales, from Pandora's box to Prometheus's fire, and transforms the adventures of Zeus and the Olympians into emotionally resonant and deeply funny stories, without losing any of their original wonder. Learned notes from the author offer rich cultural context. This volume is a doorway into a captivating world. Stephen Fry’s Mythos was kind of a perfect storm for me. I’d been both on a Greek mythology jag since reading Madeline Miller’s Circe and Song Of Achilles (both of which I heartily recommend) and a Stephen Fry jag since listening to his reading of the Holmes stories. When I saw Stephen Fry had written and narrated a book on the great Greek myths I bought it immediately and loved it from word one. Fry makes the myths and legends accessible, humorous, tragic, and horrifying, often all at once. Much like his Victorian Secrets series, Fry injects his sharp wit and keen intellect to retell the most well-known myths in history in a way that’s fresh, original, and perpetually engaging. Whether you’re a college professor, a curious tween, or a well-read pensioner there’s something for everyone here."

      "details1":"Helen Lambert has lived several lives - a young piano virtuoso in 1890s Paris, an actress in 1930's Hollywood, a rock star in 1970s Los Angeles - only she doesn't know it. Until she meets a strange man who claims he's watched over her for centuries, bound to her from the beginning. At first, Helen doesn't believe him. Her life is as normal as any other modern career woman's. Then she begins having vivid dreams about ill-fated love and lives cut short. Caught in a curse, Helen will be forced to relive the same tragic events that ruined her previous lives. But with each rebirth, she's developed uncanny powers. And as the most powerful version of herself, Helen must find a way to break the curse before her time runs out. With lush historical details and a wicked sense of humor, A Witch in Time fully immerses the reader in the story of Helen and her fated demon, unpacked like nesting dolls across time and lives, fortune and chance. From Belle Epoque France to modern-day D.C., from worlds pastoral, decadent, flashy to commercial, Sayers weaves a spell of love, lust and magic to create a page-turner like no other. All the thrill of a Discovery of Witches, with all the mystery and epic romance of Richard Matheson's classic Somewhere in Time. This is a very different story about a woman who is reincarnated based on a curse her mother placed on her. Without providing any spoilers - This is a journey of each of her lives and how she pieces together the mysteries in order to survive. It's interesting, different but you must pay attention in order to follow who is which character....and by saying that it doesn't reflect the narration, but the journey in reincarnation. I found the story dragged at times, but enjoyed the story."

Strike has never tackled a cold case before, let alone one 40 years old. But despite the slim chance of success, he is intrigued and takes it on; adding to the long list of cases that he and his partner in the agency, Robin Ellacott, are currently working on. And Robin herself is also juggling a messy divorce and unwanted male attention, as well as battling her own feelings about Strike. As Strike and Robin investigate Margot’s disappearance, they come up against a fiendishly complex case with leads that include tarot cards, a psychopathic serial killer, and witnesses who cannot all be trusted. And they learn that even cases decades old can prove to be deadly.Even if the world is the seedy underbelly of contemporary London and not Magical Hogwarts, cracking the cover of a Galbraith novel is like stepping through a portal. You're immersed all at once. Did Nick divorce Ilsa to marry Isla? It's really annoying and 100% took me out of the story. Chapter 2 also cuts off abruptly. There was an incorrect name in book 3, but that was only said once. This one is throughout the entire building book. Doesn't anybody review & edit these things before releasing them? "

At last, listeners can experience Edward's version in the long-awaited companion novel, Midnight Sun. This unforgettable tale as told through Edward's eyes takes on a new and decidedly dark twist. Meeting Bella is both the most unnerving and intriguing event he has experienced in all his years as a vampire. As we learn more fascinating details about Edward's past and the complexity of his inner thoughts, we understand why this is the defining struggle of his life. How can he justify following his heart if it means leading Bella into danger? In Midnight Sun, Stephenie Meyer transports us back to a world that has captivated millions and brings us an epic novel about the profound pleasures and devastating consequences of immortal love. As any Twihard would know, Midnight Sun has been a long time coming. I remember how devastating it was to learn that Stephenie Meyer had shelved the manuscript after the partially written draft leaked to the internet. Now, finally, we can hear Twilight from Edward's perspective, and, man, does it deliver. I couldn't have asked for a better voice for Edward Cullen than Jake Abel. His timbre and his emotional—but also strangely levelheaded—delivery captures exactly how I always imagined Edward would sound. And with 25 hours to get comfortable in the story, pretty much any detail that was glossed over in Twilight is covered here. Basically, this means my teen self can now die happy."
